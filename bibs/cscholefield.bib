a) Course textbook for an online course in enterprise identity management
b) Selecting some chapters as "homework assignments" for newcomers to our IDAM Team
c) Educating decision-makers on the governance aspects of identity management in enterprise.

His chapter 15 example of an Identity Management Maturity (IMM) model is outstanding.}

In those cases, take some tips from these authors as they assemble an admirable collection of open-source technologies, and an identity-management architecture (IMA) for enterprise. A great read, recommended to me by a respected IDAM colleague.}
